# omnibus-nikos

Omnibus-nikos is an [omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) project which builds `libdnf.a` and its dependencies. These libraries are required for building [nikos](https://github.com/DataDog/nikos) with support for RPM distributions.

This project has been specifically tailored to work on Debian Wheezy with glibc-2.16 installed (for compatability with older systems).
